Installing Nagios Core and Nagios Plugin in Linux
If you follow these instructions correctly, you will end up with the following information.

Nagios and its plugins will be installed under the /usr/local/nagios directory.
Nagios will be configured to monitor a few services of your local machine (Disk Usage, CPU Load, Current Users, Total Processes, etc.)
Nagios web interface will be available at http://localhost/nagios



Step 1:#### Ensure that the prerequisite packages are installed on your system for the successful execution of Nagios. ####Install Apache and PHP Packages
We need to install Apache, PHP, and some libraries like gcc, glibc, glibc-common, and GD libraries and their development libraries before installing Nagios with the source. And to do so, we can use the yum package installer.




$sudo su
$yum install httpd php
$yum install gcc glibc glibc-common
$yum install gd gd-devel

Step 2: Create Nagios User and Group

$adduser -m nagios
$passwd nagios


Next, add both the nagios user and the apache user to the nagcmd group using the usermod command.
$groupadd nagcmd
$usermod -a -G nagcmd nagios
$usermod -a -G nagcmd apache



Step 3: Download Nagios Core and Nagios Plugin
Create a directory for your Nagios installation and all its future downloads.

$tar -xf nagios-plugins-2.3.3.tar.gz

When you extract these tarballs, two new folders will appear in that directory.
$ls -la

Step 5: Installing and Configuring Nagios Core
Now, first, we will configure Nagios Core and to do so we need to go to the Nagios directory and run configure file if everything goes fine, it will show the output in the end as sample output.
